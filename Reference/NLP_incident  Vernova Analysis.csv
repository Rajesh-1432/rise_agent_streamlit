Before end of 2022 we were working in our old CoCo 4130 where we didn't have this error.
There is no issue authorization for VF02 and VF03 t-codes for us as we normally use everything else in those t-codes.
And we are also able to normally print to ZHRA (both now in CoCo PHR2 in the same way as we did in 4130). I'm just mentioning CoCo 4130 for comparison since we didn't have issue there, but that CoCo is closed.
Since the same error is affecting more than one user, there is probably something wrong with ZGE0 output type setup for CoCo 4130 or Sales org HR0M.

I believe Tina's issue is that, in PY1 we see her logon as TJACQES, but her SSO is 212484120.  I believe this is a disconnect when trying to use Fiori tiles. I think we need to add her SSO in PY1 so the hand off from PE1 can take place.

Please describe the issue faced in detail, including the error itself, t-codes affected, and CoCos affected:

I use SAP P37 to get technical and business data for reports and everyday tasks in the Technical Manuals team.
I raised a request to get access for Bex designer role with ticket number GERITM47435763 - which was closed.
earlier used to have access same as Carly Blaes with SSO 212608288 with SAP number 33726

I need same roles as username Carly Blaes with SSO 212608288 and her SAP number is 33726. She also wants to be contacted in case of any issue Carly.Blaes@ge.com

SAP37 access error: You are not authorized for this action (Unable to generate trace due to missing authorizat, object, activity 223103229)

previous ticket closed - ""Number: GERITM47435763
State: Closed Complete
Closed by: Mullapudi, Murali kishore (503230880)
Close notes: Service Tickets:SAP P37 does not allow report update
Request: User looking access for P37
Resolution or Suggested steps: Ideally users will not have access for Bex designer. This is critical access, Only developers will have this access. If you really wants this access please create new service now ticket along with Business justification.

Carly Blaes and I belong to the Technical Manuals - Controls Solutions & Services

Hi,

Consulting Services has just completed the transition to PowerMax and I am unable to login to production environment since yesterday. I get a message that my account is locked please see screenshot attached.

I used to have a PowerMax account previously from the Alstom time and I believe it got locked due to inactivity overtime. I was able to access the test environment (QE1) over the past few weeks after my account was unlocked but that did not seem to have unlocked my account for PE1.

What is required from you:

1. The attached list (see Final Defects Report tab) consists of accounts that have been identified as defects. Please remove the defects no later then February 8, 2024 and provide a fresh extract of the userlist.
2. Once this is done, extract a fresh role-based 'Active Application Users List' based on the documented extraction process and attach it below. The list MUST include ALL active accounts from the application
3. Provide evidences (through screenshot or observation with PMO) that confirm the extracted users list is complete and accurate. You are only required to provide screenshots that confirm the current user's list count (if possible) and the date and time stamp.
4. On receipt of the workflow, Access Management PMO Team will utilize the new active users list to test and determine that the JCT application access has been disabled/removed/downgraded

Please connect with me to provide the extracts, screenshots and for further clarification.

-PO/GR/SE access for Sophie is not working. She is having issues at the login page. Please check and correct and once it s done please Copy from Nicolas Mahop SSO 223084407 to Sophie Volmerange SSO 223084885.

Regional team's request to remove Finance and Sourcing approval from MENA PR's is now approved.
Currently PRs undergo 3 approvals. First by sourcing (facilitates early information about demand), then by Finance (ensuring correct accounting assignments â€“ cost centre, WBS, GL accounts etcâ€“ are used) and finally by Function (confirming and authorising the demand).
Sourcing buyers were part of the PR approval through a MENA initiative - PPP (Project Procurement Planning) - PMx enablement, as this is expected to provide them earlier visibility of upcoming requirements. This was deployed in mid 2022. 
Understand that Sourcing approval of PR is only in MENA region.
